# Dont-Touch-Your-Face-BRACELET
We are inspired by the many media that preach that one of the precautions that can be done to reduce the risk of being infected with covid-19 is not to touch the area around the face, because in that area is very vulnerable.   This tool is in the form of a wristband that is placed in the hand, the use of this tool is as an alarm if there are hands approaching the face. This tool uses a Passive infrared sensor and uses piezzo which if there is a movement of the hand to the face it will sound, then we also use Liquid crystal so that if it sounds then it will immediately display a warning "do not touch your face".
