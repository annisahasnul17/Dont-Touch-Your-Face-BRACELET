## "Don't Touch Your Face" BRACELET

We are inspired by the many media that preach that one of the precautions that can be done to reduce the risk of being infected with covid-19 is not to touch the area around the face, because in that area is very vulnerable.   This tool is in the form of a wristband that is placed in the hand, the use of this tool is as an alarm if there are hands approaching the face. This tool uses a Passive infrared sensor and uses piezzo which if there is a movement of the hand to the face it will sound, then we also use Liquid crystal so that if it sounds then it will immediately display a warning "do not touch your face".
